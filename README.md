**Run Instructions**

  Running our HW1 file requires Unreal Engine version 5.3.2. To run, download the contents of this GitHub repository onto your device, launch Unreal Engine version 5.3.2, and open the "LongoRadiciHW1.uproject" file when prompted to open a project. Once in the engine, hit the green "play" button at the top of the viewport to begin the game from the Menu screen. 
  
  From the menu, clicking the start button will begin the game from the first hazards level, while clicking the quit button will close the play screen. Shooting and destroying each target in the first hazards level will immediately load you into the second hazards level, where you must again destroy each target. Upon doing so, you will be returned to the menu, where you can choose to play again or to quit.

  Upon beginning the hazards levels, move to a rifle to pick it up. You begin with 30 ammo and can shoot with the left mouse button - but once your ammo reaches 0, you can shoot no longer. There are ammo pickups that look like cups of the ammo projectile that you can run over to collect 10 more ammo. 
  
  In the hazards levels, there are hazards that can damage you. You begin with 100 health, and getting down to 0 or below will restart whichever level you are on. Lava will instantly kill you, while spikes will only do 50 damage each. Health can be regained using life packs, each one yielding 25 health.
